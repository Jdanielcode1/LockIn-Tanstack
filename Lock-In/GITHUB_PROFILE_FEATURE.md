## üìù Technical Notes

### Performance
- Uses Suspense boundaries for data fetching
- Pagination support (currently loading 100 projects)
- Efficient contribution data queries (only loads selected year)

### Routing
- Uses TanStack Router file-based routing
- Parent route (`/projects`) conditionally renders:
  - Profile page (no child route)
  - `<Outlet />` (when child route like `$projectId` is active)

### State Management
- React Query for server state
- Local state for UI (tabs, modals)
- No global state needed

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
