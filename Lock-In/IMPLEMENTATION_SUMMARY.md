## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Architecture Decisions

1. **No Authentication (MVP)**
   - Simplified initial implementation
   - Easy to add later with Convex Auth
   - Focus on core features first

2. **Cloudflare R2 for Storage**
   - No egress fees (unlike S3)
   - S3-compatible API
   - Generous free tier
   - Excellent performance

3. **TanStack Router**
   - Type-safe routing
   - File-based routing
   - Built-in code splitting
   - Excellent DX

4. **Convex Backend**
   - Real-time subscriptions
   - Type-safe API
   - Built-in auth support (for future)
   - Serverless scaling

### Performance Optimizations

- ✅ Pagination on all list queries
- ✅ Suspense queries for parallel data loading
- ✅ Indexed database queries
- ✅ Signed URL caching (24-hour expiry)
- ✅ Lazy-loaded routes
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates possible

### Data Flow

```
User Action → Frontend Component → Convex Mutation → Database Update
                                                    ↓
                                              R2 Storage (videos)
                                                    ↓
                                          Real-time Subscription
                                                    ↓
                                            UI Auto-updates
```

## 📊 Database Relationships

```
Projects (1) ──→ (Many) Timelapses
                           ↓
                     (Many) Likes
                           ↓
                     (Many) Comments
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- [ ] User authentication (Convex Auth)
- [ ] Video thumbnail generation
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] User profiles

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Video transcoding for optimal streaming
- [ ] Project categories/tags
- [ ] Follow system
- [ ] Notifications
- [ ] Share to social media

### Low Priority
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Export project data
- [ ] Collaborative projects
- [ ] Private projects

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Current Architecture Scales To:
- **Projects**: Millions (indexed queries)
- **Timelapses**: Millions (paginated, indexed)
- **Videos**: Limited by R2 storage (10GB free, unlimited paid)
- **Comments**: Millions per timelapse (paginated)
- **Concurrent Users**: Auto-scales with Convex

### Bottlenecks to Watch:
1. Video upload size (implement size limits)
2. R2 Class A operations (uploads are metered)
3. Convex function execution time (10s limit per function)

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create project
- [ ] Upload video (small file first)
- [ ] View video in feed
- [ ] Click through to video detail
- [ ] Add comment
- [ ] Like/unlike video
- [ ] Update project status
- [ ] Delete timelapse
- [ ] Delete project

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Unit tests for Convex functions
- Integration tests for upload flow
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Performance tests for video streaming

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Current State (No Auth)
- Anyone can create/delete projects
- Anyone can upload videos
- Anyone can comment/like
- No rate limiting

### When Adding Auth
- Implement user ownership of projects
- Add authorization checks to mutations
- Rate limit uploads per user
- Implement comment moderation
- Add report/flag functionality

## 💰 Cost Estimate

### Cloudflare R2 (Free Tier)
- 10 GB storage (50-200 videos)
- 1M Class A operations (uploads)
- 10M Class B operations (views)

### Convex (Free Tier)
- 1 GB database storage
- 1M function calls/month
- 1 GB bandwidth

### For 100 Active Users
- ~500 videos uploaded/month
- ~50 GB storage needed ($0.75/month)
- ~100K video views ($0/month - within free tier)
- **Total: <$1/month**

## 📝 Key Learnings

1. **R2 Setup**: CORS configuration is critical for client uploads
2. **Convex Patterns**: Use indexes instead of filters for performance
3. **Type Safety**: Proper typing makes refactoring painless
4. **Real-time**: Convex subscriptions provide instant updates
5. **Components**: R2 component handles complex upload logic

## 🎉 Success Metrics
